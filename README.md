# AlitaGPT Lite Paper: A Rational AI Model for Trading Markets
 
## From a Legendary Trader

**Question: Who is the most influential investment and trading master in modern history?**


**Buffett? Soros?**
Yet, if this question were posed to active traders, with a probability of over 80%, there would be only one answer.


**Jesse Livermore**


In 1929, he famously shorted the entire United States, prompting the White House to request him to cease; he also shorted cotton futures, turning into a legendary trader where the market could scarcely find a bale of cotton. His memoir, "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator," documenting his career, was published in 1940. Even after over 80 years, this book remains essential reading for successful traders.
